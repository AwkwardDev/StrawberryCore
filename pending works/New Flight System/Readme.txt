The system is working but there are some problems..

1- The players who flying from flight master can not speak with any npc after flying done.

2- Some of the old system's functions must adapt to the new system. 
For example there is a function that the player can enter to any bg while flying and 
after bg is finished the player must teleport to current fly point and continue from 
that point to fly.

3- Commands must adapt to new system too. For example if a gm going to summon a player(.summon X) 
while the player is flying from flight master, then server will crashed.
